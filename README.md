Download the free, open source version of FileZilla at [`https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1`](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1)

During class today, you were given your username and password to access the MMP servers.

Launch FileZilla and use the aforementioned credentials as follows:

**Host**: `mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu` . 
**Username**: `Your username` . 
**Password**: `Your password` . 
**Port**: `Leave blank`

The URL to the root folder of your account is [`http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME`](http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME).

Per our discussion in class today, you were to create folders in your MMP server account that pointed to the following URLs:

* `http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-1/`
* `http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-2/`
* `http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-3/`
* `http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-4/`
* `http://mmp.bmcc.cuny.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/spring-2018/mmp-100/project-5/`

And lastly, you were to add projectâ€™s 1 and 2 to the `project-1` and `project-2` folders.
